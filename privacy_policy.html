    <h1>Privacy Policy for SwipeLock</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: November 29, 2024</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>SwipeLock ("we", "our", "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This
            privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <h3>Photos and Videos</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> SwipeLock accesses your photos and videos stored locally on your device for
                viewing purposes only.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> All photos and videos remain on your device. We do not upload, store, or
                transmit your media files to our servers or any third-party servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Media files are only accessed when you open the app and are used solely for
                display within the app's gallery and viewer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Analytics Data</h3>
        <p>We use Firebase Analytics to improve our app. The following anonymous data may be collected:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Device information (model, OS version, screen size)</li>
            <li>App usage statistics (features used, session duration)</li>
            <li>Anonymous user identifier (Firebase Installation ID)</li>
            <li>App install date and version</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> This data is anonymous and cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All your photos and videos remain on your device. We do not have access
                to them.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> Only anonymous analytics data is stored in Firebase (Google's secure
                cloud platform).</li>
            <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or
                any other personally identifiable information.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> For analytics and app configuration. Firebase's privacy policy: <a
                    href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Your Rights and Control</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Photo Access:</strong> You can revoke photo access permissions at any time through your device
                settings (Settings → Apps → SwipeLock → Permissions).</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> You can disable analytics by uninstalling the app. We do not offer an
                opt-out within the app as the data collected is minimal and anonymous.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> Since we do not store your photos or personal data, uninstalling the app
                removes all app-related data from your device.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>SwipeLock does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. The app is designed for
            general audiences.</p>
